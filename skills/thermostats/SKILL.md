# Control thermostat settings

Discover the intended thermostat and its declared capabilities from [the directory](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/capability-interfaces.md). Retrieve the exact setpoint/mode schema before sending. Preserve declared units, supported mode names and temperature bounds; never assume Celsius/Fahrenheit.

## Use MCP

- `endpoint_query` finds the thermostat. Ask for its thermostat and temperature-sensor expansions with `forceDeviceAttributeQuery: true`. The room temperature is the temperature-sensor reading, never the setpoint.
- `control` sends the declared setpoint or mode command with its documented payload. For a relative change such as "a bit warmer", start from a fresh current setpoint, and ask for a target when none is available.
- Ordinary absolute setpoint/mode commands use `waitForResult: false`; acknowledge accepted/pending and stop. Read again only for requested verification or uncertain-outcome diagnosis. Use `endpoint_show` when the customer asks for a card or controls; never draw your own card.

## Use the HTTP API

Use [authorized REST dispatch](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/guides/quickstart.md). Read fresh mode/setpoint/temperature observations after the command. A committed target setting does not prove the room has reached that temperature. Report delayed or unavailable observations honestly and do not repeat relative adjustments after an unknown response.
