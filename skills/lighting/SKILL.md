# How to turn off your lights

1. Find your lights by listing your devices.
2. Check each device's capabilities and type.
3. Turn them off.

## Before you start: what does "all lights" mean?

"All lights", "the lights" and "lights" depend on your habits. Common meanings:

1. Turn off every light you own.
2. Turn off the lights in the room you are in.
3. Turn off every light in a group you named "all lights".
4. Turn off every light, switch and plug in one group, such as the main house, and leave the other groups alone.

Decide which of these you mean, and use the same meaning each time. If you are unsure, start with every endpoint of the `LIGHT` type. That is not always right, because some lamps are plugged into a switch or plug instead.

## Lights, switches and plugs

Start with authorized endpoint discovery and inspect each endpoint's capability declarations. A room name can be ambiguous, so select by full ID and group path, or name the room yourself. A plug or switch that supports power is not automatically a light.

Sometimes "turn off the lights" means turning off a plug or switch that a lamp is connected to. When you search for an endpoint, check plugs and switches as well as lights, and check that it is the lamp you mean before you switch it off.

## Lights in someone else's home

The lights may belong to someone else who shared them with you, for example when you are house sitting or staying in a rented home. Shared endpoints are not included by default. Add an explicit owner, endpoint ID or group selector to include them.

## Fix confusing data

Fix the data so that your devices are easy to recognize. For example, change a plug that powers a lamp to the `LIGHT` type. If a device does not work, disable it so that it stops appearing in default results.

## Use MCP

Connect your AI client with the steps in [How to use MCP](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/how-to-use-mcp/). Then ask your assistant to do the work, or call these tools directly:

- `endpoint_query` lists devices. It returns each device's type, capabilities and message IDs. Call it without a `query` to load everything, or narrow it with a type filter such as `{"type": {"eq": "LIGHT"}}`. Pass the returned `nextToken` back until none is returned. Ask for `expand: ["power"]` to read power state, and add `forceDeviceAttributeQuery: true` to read it from the device instead of the cache.
- `group_query` lists groups, their parent path, child groups and members. Use it to resolve a room to a full group ID.
- `control` sends a command. Copy `id` and `message` from the query results, for example the `turn-off` message of the power capability, and send `payload: {}`. A color uses `set-color` with `{"color":{"hue":240,"saturation":100,"brightness":100}}`: hue in degrees (0 to 360), saturation and brightness in percent (0 to 100). That example is blue.
- `endpoint_show` shows a device's card. After a change, read the light again with `forceDeviceAttributeQuery: true`, then call `endpoint_show` with each changed light's exact endpoint ID, one call per light, and answer in a sentence or two next to the card. Never draw your own card.
- `endpoint_manage` repairs data. Its operations are `RENAME`, `SET_TYPE`, `SET_ENABLEMENT`, `MERGE_INTO` and `DELETE`. Copy the full endpoint ID from `endpoint_query`, and understand the effect before you merge or delete.
- `group_manage` creates, renames, merges and deletes groups, and changes their members.

Check the results to see which lights were selected, which commands were accepted, and which failed.

## Use the HTTP API

Authorize with a bearer token that has the endpoint and message permissions you need. See [authorization rules](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/guides/authorization-rules.md).

### Find lights

For one bulb, read its power, brightness and color message schemas in [the capability directory](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/capability-interfaces.md). Use the exact namespace, version, message name, units and constraints it returns. [The quickstart](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/guides/quickstart.md) shows the generic message envelope.

For "all lights", call [endpointQuery](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/operations/endpointQuery.md) with `endpoint:read` permission and filter by the `LIGHT` type:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "match": {"key": "type", "value": "LIGHT"}
  },
  "paginationContext": {"maxResults": 25}
}
```

Type-only queries return the caller's own endpoints. To include a shared endpoint, add an explicit owner or endpoint ID selector. A group selector can include shared members once `group:read` and group access checks pass.

For a room, first resolve its full group ID with [group discovery](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/guides/managing-groups.md). Then add `{"match":{"key":"groupId","value":"<resolved-full-group-id>"}}` to the `and` list of the query. This also requires `group:read` and permission to read that group. A group filter returns the group's member endpoints. Resolve nested groups as needed and remove duplicate endpoint IDs. Reading a group does not grant control of its members.

Repeat the same query, page size and authenticated grant with `paginationContext.nextToken` from each response. Continue until the token is absent, including after an empty page. Disabled endpoints are excluded by default. Check each selected endpoint's declared capabilities, and drop targets that do not support power. Do not widen the selection to every plug or switch. Freeze the target list before you send commands, and report each result.

### Read state

To read live state, call [endpointQuery](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/operations/endpointQuery.md) with `expand: ["interfaces.attributes"]` and `forceDeviceQuery: true`. The same options exist on `GET /endpoints`: send `id=<endpoint-id>`, `expand=interfaces.attributes` and `forceDeviceAttributeQuery=true`. Check each observation's sample time and any partial errors before you say a light changed.

A batch can partly succeed. Report selected, accepted, failed and unresolved targets separately. A lost response is not a reason to repeat a relative brightness change.

### Control lights

Send each command with [sendMessage](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/operations/sendMessage.md): `POST /messages` with the target endpoint and a message that names the capability namespace, message name and version. To turn a light off:

```json
{
  "target": {
    "type": "ENDPOINT",
    "id": "<full-endpoint-id-from-discovery>"
  },
  "message": {
    "header": {
      "namespace": "port1/systems/zero/capability-interfaces/power",
      "name": "turn-off",
      "version": "1.0"
    },
    "body": {}
  }
}
```

An accepted command does not prove the light is off. Read the state again to confirm.
