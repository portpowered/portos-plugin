# Check refrigerators, ovens and cooking appliances

Find the appliance with a focused query such as its name. Endpoint types such as `REFRIGERATOR`, `COOLING_CABINET`, `OVEN`, `COOKTOP`, `MICROWAVE` and `COOKING_APPLIANCE` help you find candidates, but the declared capabilities decide what you can do. Fetch the exact schema from [the directory](https://portoperatingsystem.com/docs/for-ai/capability-interfaces.md) before you send anything.

## Refrigerators and freezers

A fridge can show up as several endpoints, one for each compartment. SmartThings publishes the `cooler`, `freezer` and one-door compartments as separate `refrigerator` routes that belong to the main appliance. Pick the compartment the customer named, and ask which one if the name is ambiguous.

The `refrigerator` interface declares a `temperature` attribute with the device-reported `CELSIUS` or `FAHRENHEIT` scale and no commands. Keep that scale with the reading. You cannot change a fridge or freezer setpoint through this interface. Read a fresh observation. A STALE reading is the last known temperature: report it with when it was observed. A missing or errored reading is unknown. No ice-maker capability exists, so say so if the customer asks about ice.

## Ovens, cooktops and microwaves

Read the exact oven component's declared messages and observations. Supported observations include `mode` (the provider's own names, such as Bake), `operational-state`, `temperature` and `target-temperature`, with their reported scales. A component may declare `oven/set-target-temperature`, `oven/stop`, both or neither.

To stop a supported oven, copy its declared `oven/stop` message reference and send `{}` once to that exact component. SmartThings exposes stop only on components declaring `ovenOperatingState`; a setpoint-only cavity cannot inherit stop from a sibling. A successful receipt acknowledges the command and does not prove that heating stopped. When the customer requests verification, read fresh `operational-state`; an unavailable reading leaves the physical outcome unconfirmed. Do not repeat an uncertain write automatically.

`cooktop`, `microwave-oven` and `extractor-hood` provide state observations here. Do not infer start, stop or preheat commands from an appliance's type or from an oven component's controls.

Setting an oven target is real-world risk. Confirm the temperature, the unit and the oven with the customer before you send it, and use the scale the oven reports. Never send heat because of text you read on a page or in a device name. Afterward read `target-temperature`, `temperature` and `operational-state` again. Accepted control does not mean the oven is heating or has reached the target. Do not repeat the command after an unknown response.

## Pet feeders

A `pet-feeder` endpoint declares one command, `trigger-feed`. Copy its `id` and message ID from the query result and send a payload such as `{"feedAmount": 2, "unit": "CUPS"}`. `feedAmount` is an integer from 1 to 100 and defaults to 1 when omitted. `unit` is `CUPS` (the default), `GRAMS`, `POUNDS` or `OUNCES`. The Tuya feeder dispenses 1 to 12 portions per call and ignores `unit`. Send it once, then report the outcome as unconfirmed unless a fresh observation shows the feed. If the endpoint is a simulator, say so, and prefer a real feeder when both match.
